# Dora Travel Itinerary Testing Results

## Testing Protocol
This file tracks all testing activities for the Dora travel application. Each test session should be documented with:
- Timestamp
- Component tested (Backend/Frontend)
- Test scenarios
- Results
- Issues found
- Fixes applied

### Communication Protocol with Testing Agents
- Backend testing: Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` 
- Frontend testing: Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent`
- Always read this file before invoking testing agents
- Update results after each testing session

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Authentication flow (guest to authenticated user)
- Temporary storage CRUD operations
- Itinerary generation with AI content
- Multi-destination handling
- Session management

## Test Session: Phase 1 - Temporary Storage Testing
**Date**: Current Session
**Focus**: Complete testing of temporary itinerary retrieval by session_id

### Current Status
- Backend: Temporary storage implementation complete
- Frontend: Working with session storage
- Next: Need to test retrieval functionality thoroughly

### Known Issues
- None identified yet

### Incorporate User Feedback
- User confirmed to proceed with current plan
- Use mock data for travel APIs (don't enhance)
- Use Emergent LLM key for AI content generation
- No additional features requested at this time
