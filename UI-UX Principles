### **Guiding Design Principles**

*   **Clarity & Simplicity:** The interface should feel effortless. The user's goal is to get a plan, not to learn a complex app.
*   **Trust & Credibility:** The design should feel professional and reliable, assuring users that the generated itinerary is intelligent and valuable.
*   **Guided Journey:** The multi-step form should feel progressive and rewarding, not overwhelming.
*   **Delight:** Small touches like thoughtful micro-interactions, a beautiful PDF, and clear feedback will make the product stand out.

### **Milestone 1: Static Itinerary Generator (Weeks 2-3)**

#### **Feature: Multi-Step Form**
*   **User Journey:** The user lands on the homepage, which is primarily the form. They are guided through a linear process: 1) Destination & Dates, 2) Travel Preferences, 3) Review. A progress bar keeps them informed.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   **Progress Stepper:** Horizontal bar at the top with labels (e.g., "Trip," "Preferences," "Review") and highlighted steps.
    *   **Card:** The form is contained within a centered card with a medium shadow (`shadow-md`).
    *   **Input Fields:** Full-width, with a light border, small border radius, and padding. Labels are above inputs in muted text.
    *   **Buttons:** "Next" button is primary blue and on the right. "Back" button is a secondary (border-only) style on the left.
*   **UX Best Practices:**
    *   **Smart Defaults:** Pre-fill `user_name` from a cookie if possible later. Default `party_size` to 2.
    *   **Validation:** Validate on "Next." Invalid fields get a red border and a short, specific error message below the field (e.g., "Please select a return date.").
    *   **Feedback:** Buttons should show a loading spinner and be disabled while the "next" action is processing (even with mock data, to build the habit).

#### **Feature: Itinerary Preview**
*   **User Journey:** After submitting the form, the user sees a loading skeleton for 1-2 seconds (simulating work), then the preview slides in or fades in.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   **Preview Card:** A prominent card using the surface background color (`bg-slate-50`).
    *   **Day Tabs:** Horizontal tabbed interface for "Day 1," "Day 2," etc. Active tab is underlined with the primary color.
    *   **Itinerary Item:** Each activity/hotel/flight is a list item (`<li>`) with an icon (e.g., üõ´ for flight, üè® for hotel), time, title, and description. Affiliate links are styled as primary buttons ("Book Now").
    *   **Download Button:** A large, high-contrast button with a download icon. It should look clickable and important.
*   **UX Best Practices:**
    *   **Scannability:** Use plenty of whitespace and icons to make the dense information easy to scan.
    *   **Clear CTAs:** Affiliate links must be obvious buttons. The primary CTA is "Download as PDF."
    *   **Responsiveness:** On mobile, the day tabs might scroll horizontally. The card should stack nicely.

### **Milestone 2: Backend Orchestrator & API Adapters (Weeks 4-5)**

*(UI/UX for this milestone is about handling the transition from static to dynamic data.)*

*   **User Journey:** Unchanged from M1, but now the loading state after form submission is real.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   **Loading State:** A more detailed skeleton loader that mimics the structure of the actual itinerary preview (e.g., lines of text for titles, rectangles for images) builds confidence that something is happening.
*   **UX Best Practices:**
    *   **Error States:** Design for API failures. If the flight API fails, the preview should still show, but the flight section should display a friendly message: "We couldn't fetch live flight data. Here's a sample option to consider: [Mock Flight]". This is crucial for reliability.

---

### **Milestone 3: Authentication Gate & User System (Week 6)**

#### **Feature: Auth Gate Modal**
*   **User Journey:** User clicks "Download as PDF." Instead of downloading, a modal gracefully overlays the page. The user can sign up/login without losing their context (the itinerary is preserved in the background).
*   **UI Components:**
    *   **Modal/Overlay:** A semi-transparent dark overlay (`bg-black/50`) covers the screen. A centered, white card contains the auth form.
    *   **Tabs:** "Login" and "Sign Up" tabs within the modal.
    *   **OAuth Buttons:** A button for "Continue with Google" with the Google logo. Styled with a border, full width.
    *   **Separator:** "or" with horizontal lines on a muted text line.
    *   **Email/Password Form:** Standard inputs for email and password. For sign-up, a "Confirm Password" field.
*   **UX Best Practices:**
    *   **Social Login First:** Place "Continue with Google" above the email form, as it's faster and has higher conversion.
    *   **Clear Benefits:** Include a short line of text: "Sign up to download your personalized PDF itinerary."
    *   **Seamless Transition:** After successful auth, the modal should close *smoothly* and *then* the download should immediately start (in M4). The user should never be left wondering what happened.

---

### **Milestone 4: PDF Generation & Delivery (Week 7)**

*   **User Journey:** Post-authentication, the modal closes and the PDF download begins automatically in the browser.
*   **UI Components:**
    *   **Toast Notification:** A small toast message appears in the corner of the screen: "Your itinerary is downloading!" with a success checkmark icon. This provides crucial feedback that the action was completed.
*   **UX Best Practices:**
    *   **Automatic Download:** Do not require a second click. The user already expressed intent by clicking "Download" and then authenticating.
    *   **Feedback is Mandatory:** The toast notification is essential. Without it, if the browser blocks the download, the user has no idea if it worked.

---

### **Milestone 5: Second API Integration & Polish (Week 8)**

*   **User Journey:** The journey is now complete and robust.
*   **UI Components (for Error Handling):**
    *   **Empty States:** Design components for when no results are found from an API. Use an illustration icon (e.g., a magnifying glass) and helpful text: "We couldn't find any hotels matching your criteria. Try adjusting your budget or theme."
*   **UX Best Practices:**
    *   **Parallel Loading:** Ensure the UI doesn't wait for all APIs to respond. Show a skeleton for each section (Flights, Hotels, Activities) independently. As each API call returns, fill in that section. This makes the app feel much faster.
    *   **Final Polish:**
        *   Add subtle hover effects on buttons and cards (`hover:shadow-lg`, `hover:scale-[1.01]`).
        *   Add smooth transitions for all interactive elements (`transition-all duration-200`).
        *   Ensure focus states are clear and visible for keyboard navigation.
        *   Test performance (Lighthouse) and optimize images/scripts.
